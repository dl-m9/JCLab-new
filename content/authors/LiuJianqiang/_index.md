# Biography
<!-- <p style="text-align:justify">  -->
I am an assistant professor with the CS Department at NC State University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida in 2018 and B.Eng. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2013.

My lab's research interest is to tackle the security, data privacy, and communication & networking challenges in future communication systems such as 5G (beyond) and quantum internet. The applied methodology includes theories (e.g., optimization, control, and statistics) and experiments (e.g., reverse-engineering, system implementation, and hardware-software co-design). Our mission is to build more secure and functional communication systems for the future connected world.
