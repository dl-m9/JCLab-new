I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), leading the **W**ireless **I**nformation & Inte**ll**igence (**WILL**) lab. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yuguang Fang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~yugufang/), and my B.Eng. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2017. I received 2022 ECE graduate excellence award for research from the University of Florida.

**If you are interested in working with me as a Ph.D. student/research assistant, please feel free to drop me an email including your CV, transcript, and sample publications (if any)**. Due to the volume of email inquiries, I may only be able to contact shortlisted candidates (usually within one week). Thanks for your understanding.
